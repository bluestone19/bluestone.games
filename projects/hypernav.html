        <h2>Developer Notes</h2>
        <p>I've dreamt of designing a game console from the ground up. If there's one thing I like, it's weird indie gadgets, and I want to make my own. Of course that's a huge task, but I've been trying to learn how to do it. Don't expect anything to actually come from this.</p>
        <p>If I did want to make a game console, though, I would want it to have these features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed to be a handheld</li>
            <li>Modular architecture encouraging accessories and custom hardware</li>
            <li>Totally open source in every way. You wouldn't buy it from me, you'd take my schematics and designs and build your own, but it would still be standardized enough that games or accessories for one person's device could be used on someone else's</li>
            <li>No money in the hardware design. Just a passion project</li>
            <li>Anyone can make games or software for it</li>
            <li>You don't have to be a developer to enjoy it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I like to chip away at the specific details sometimes when I'm free. If anything ever comes from this, I'll definitely post about it on twitter or something.</p>
        <p>Of course, this is nothing more than a dream. I'll probably never get anywhere with this.</p>
