        <h2>Developer Notes</h2>
        <p>The version I've got here is not the original I posted on the BBS, it's a version we worked on a bit more with slightly more tolerable music and new sprites.</p>
        <p>The original was first made pretty soon after I was introduced to Pico-8, and Lucas wanted to make something too. It was also in the summer, and he likes Minecraft, so that's the explanation for the floaties and gem tools.</p>
        <p>Originally, the game was supposed to have turn based battles or something but we never bothered to make that. That's what those random "enemies" in the grass were supposed to be for.</p>
        <p>Can you find the secret 12th chest?</p>
