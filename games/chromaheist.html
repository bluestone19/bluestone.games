        <h2>Developer Notes</h2>
        <p>I wanted to make a third and final "outline" game, finishing the "series" that The Untitled Experiment and Bluestone's Awakening were "in." The idea is that there'd be four colors, controlled by artifacts that you had to steal to gain their power.</p>
        <p>This was sitting in my folder as pretty much nothing more than 25% of a map and a vague concept. It wasn't really worth posting in that state, since there wasn't even anything to play. So, I just decided to finish it. It's pretty much just <a href="dad.html">"dad"</a> but with a more definitive ending.</p>
