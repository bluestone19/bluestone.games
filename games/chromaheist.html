        <h2>Developer Notes</h2>
        <p>I wanted to make a third and final "outline" game, finishing the "series" that The Untitled Experiment and Bluestone's Awakening were "in." The idea is that there'd be four colors, controlled by artifacts that you had to steal to gain their power.</p>
        <p>However, spoiler, when you steal all the things, and all of the colors are drained from the world, you die too. I dunno either man.</p>
