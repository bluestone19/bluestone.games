        <h1>The Amazing Bluestone</h1>
        <p>Bluestone can switch states of matter whenever he wants. Good for him</p>
        <h2>Controls & Gameplay</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Left & Right Arrow Keys: Move</li>
            <li>Z or C: Jump</li>
            <li>X or V: Swap States</li>
            <li>Get to the end of the levels. Your properties change as you switch states, so you have to be careful about your surroundings.</li>
            <li>As a liquid, you can slip through grates.</li>
            <li>As a gas, you can jump higher, but will be destroyed by fans.</li>
            <li>As a solid, you can walk on grates without falling.</li>
            <li>Heating or cooling elements can shift your state up or down.</li>

        <h2>Developer Notes</h2>
        <p>This hadn't been posted anywhere before, but I wanna put up some of my unfinished/abandoned stuff on this site. I think a lot of these proof-of-concepts are at least fun enough to mess around in, so it'd be selfish to keep this trash to myself.</p>
        <p>The physics are based on Super Mega Bread. I kinda thought it'd be cool to have a game where you have to rapidly switch states to platform around.</p>
