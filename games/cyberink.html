        <h2>Developer Notes</h2>
        <p>I like to tell myself that one day I'll make this game. I like to think of it as the ultimate project, and everything else I make is just a side project I work on while procrastinating.</p>
        <p>The title "Cyber Ink" is cause the game involves getting a job as an artist, until some scary technology stuff happens. I didn't come up with it. Like a lot of the important skeletal structure of this game, it was helped along and guided if not conceptualized by my friend Zach Kozidowski.</p>
        <p>It's essentially the next iteration of Rise of Illusions. Personally, I was kinda playing with the idea of having this game tie together everything else I make. There are elements of this project in a lot of my games. Here's a few:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bluestone's Awakening: Late in the game, there's a grabbable item that's a purple orb, and others that are robots. There's also a sphere covered in lenses in the background.</li>
            <li>Tachyon's Escape: The entire game is meant to be set in this game's setting. The vague story in the dialogue refers to things from this game.</li>
            <li>Rhythsomnia: The final boss is a character recycled from Cyber Ink.</li>
        </ul>
