        <h2>Developer Notes</h2>
        <p>This game's original plan had a bit more substance than what actually got made. The idea was that each creature had a different elemental attack. You could use the special attacks of creatures you collected to negate the attacks of the panicking creatures, or to capture or move them. Of course this was made for a game jam, so I didn't have time for all that.</p>
        <p>The jam this was made for was the Fantasy Console Jam #1 held on itch.io in 2017. This was my first ever jam game.</p>
