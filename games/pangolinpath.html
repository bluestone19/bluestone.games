        <h1>Pangolin Path</h1>
        <p>Poachers are watching your every move, so you need to keep them on their toes to avoid getting caught.</p>
        <h2>Developer Notes</h2>
        <p>This was made for the Pizza Jam, a game jam run on itch.io in 2018. I didn't have much experience with actually exporting Unity games, and was using a mac and didn't have a PC to test on, and the game itself wasn't really worth playing, so I didn't quite win.</p>
        <p>The idea of the game was that you'd have to memorize your steps so you could avoid tiles you already stepped on. It wasn't all that fun in practice.</p>
        <p>As for the theme, I think I just asked my mom, and she said I should make a game about pangolin poaching. So I did. Not that you could really tell in the game. I wanted to have a net that'd fall down and catch you when you lost, but that didn't happen.</p>
        <p>The itch page is no longer public, and I don't think I'll be doing anything more with this game in the future. If you really want me to send you the game, send me an email and I might dig around my computer. Just trust me when I say it really isn't worth the effort.</p>
