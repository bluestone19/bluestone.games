        <h1>Rise of Illusions</h1>
        <p>This page serves as a eulogy for a dead project.</p>

        <h2>Developer Notes</h2>
        <p>This project was the start of my descent into madness. I decided, arbitrarily, I wanted to make an RPG about my experience in middle school. It wouldn't be accurate, of course. It'd feature monsters, stationery-based combat, and bullies (which I didn't really have to deal with in reality.)</p>
        <p>There were several attempts at this project, and some say there still are to this day. Here's a quick run-through of the different versions I can remember:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Flash game made with Stencyl: Only ever made a testing area, with a character based on myself and basic testing characters I named debug-men.</li>
            <li>Visual Basic: In my first computer science class, I had to make a game as a final project. Reused sprites from the first version, with maybe minor tweaks.</li>
            <li>Javascript: New sprites that are taller. Pretty much remade the areas and characters of the visual basic version, but with a new grid-based battle system.</li>
            <li>Unity: Same sprites as last version. Leaned even further into sci-fi stuff.</li>
            <li>Unity V2: Completely removed myself as a character in the game. New cast of characters and setting.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It's hard to tell where Rise of Illusions ends and where Cyber Ink begins. That Unity V2 version is pretty much halfway between both. I only separate the two since I think they're two very different games, and I wanted to make them for very different reasons. Theoretically, I could make both games, it's not like one is just a replacement for the other. If I were to make one though, I'd make Cyber Ink.</p>
