        <h2>Developer Notes</h2>
        <p>In middle school, me and my friends talked about making a series of games under the name "Super Mega Bread." Of course, at the time none of us were actually able to make a game. But later, in one of my highschool Computer Science classes, one of the final projects was to make a game, so I chose to make Super Mega Bread in Pico-8 for real. While I was at it I figured I'd put it up on Itch.io.</p>
        <p>This game was part of the Premium Pico-8 Bundle, which was incredibly cool. Apparently there aren't too many Pico-8 games that are sold instead of just being free. I mostly did that just to see what'd happen, and to kinda pretend I'm a "professional game developer," making money off of my work. I've thought about offering it for free, but I'm not really sure.</p>
        <p>It's kinda hard to go back to playing this. I was making a sequel to it, with much better controls/gameplay, but that's far from being done. So, I started remaking the original with the improvements from the second, and it seems promising but I gotta get around to fully finishing it. I do not recommend buying this original version yet, since a better version will come out eventually. However, if you want to try pirating it, send me an email, I might send you a copy of it. Don't tell the devs.</p>
