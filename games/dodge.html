        <h2>Developer Notes</h2>
        <p>The idea for this one was from back when I was messing with a piece of software called Stencyl, which let you make flash games pretty easily. Me and my sister wanted to make a simple game, so our idea was this. She designed the characters.</p>
        <p>Actually, I think the idea for this dates back further to me and my friends' Minecraft server... I tried to make an arcade machine with a redstone lamp screen where you <i>dodge</i> falling things. I think that came first, but I really can't be sure.</p>
