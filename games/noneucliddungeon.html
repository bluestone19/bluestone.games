        <h2>Developer Notes</h2>
        <p>I thought it was kinda neat, but it isn't really a fun game to play. Like most of my projects, I was way more interested in making something I think is neat than something that people would want to play.</p>
        <p>If you can make it to the end without cheating, send me a screenshot and I'll be very impressed.</p>
