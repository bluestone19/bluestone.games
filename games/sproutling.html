        <h2>Developer Notes</h2>
        <p>This project was started in highschool, around the same time as Super Mega Bread and The Amazing Bluestone. In fact, it uses the same basic physics. My idea was to have a set of little pico-8 platformers that all interconnected somehow.</p>
        <p>Can you guess what inspired the vine-growing attack thing? I'll give you a hint: it's from Nintendo.</p>
        <p>Don't bother actually walking through the game, but I believe there's three finished backgrounds in this latest version: the forest, the city, and a castle.</p>
