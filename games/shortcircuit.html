        <h2>Developer Notes</h2>
        <p>I wanted to make a simple tile-swapping puzzle game, kinda like puzzle league. So I made this. I thought the way the tiles lit up was kinda cool, but I don't think anyone else really cared for its fairly slow controls. This badly needed some mouse support or something.</p>
