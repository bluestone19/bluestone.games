        <p>A lil' orange slime has to collect all its pieces.</p>

        <h2>Developer Notes</h2>
        <p>I just think lil' slime blobs with dot eyes are cute. Also, the game is very much inspired by Metroid, as I think anyone could tell.</p>
        <p>SPOILERS FOR THE ENDING BELOW</p>
        <p>I was kinda hoping people would be thinking of Metroid by the time they beat the game. The long vertical escape, then a scene outside on the surface, with the main character center screen before flashing rapidly and changing.</p>
        <p>I kinda thought it would be a funny bait-and-switch that the slime just becomes bigger and that's it. Given the original Metroid ending was supposed to be a big reveal, I hoped people would expect the same from this game and then be let down.</p>
