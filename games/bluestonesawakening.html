        <h1>Bluestone's Awakening</h1>
        <p>Bluestone is a little blob that's asleep. Now he's gotta wake up by delivering presents to his friends.</p>

        <h2>Controls & Gameplay</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Left & Right Arrow Keys: Move</li>
            <li>Down Arrow Key: Crouch</li>
            <li>Z or C: Jump</li>
            <li>X or V: Pick up or drop item</li>
            <li>To hide from enemies, crouch while holding an item. You'll be safe while hiding, and the enemy will not be able to see or chase you.</li>
            <li>Each of the characters has an item they like, but might accept something else instead.</li>
            <li>If you're cornered or stuck, it might help to jump and either hide or show yourself. You can trick an enemy into running away!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Developer Notes</h2>
        <p>I wanted to make a kinda-sequel to <a href="untitledexperiment.html">The Untitled Experiment</a>, and reuse Bluestone as a character from past attempted projects.</p>
