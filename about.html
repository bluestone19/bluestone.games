        <h1>About Everything</h1>
        <h2>About Jonas Clermont</h2>
        <p>How are you? I'm Jonas, and I'm trying to make video games. I hope you'll give some of my work a try. Or, if you ever want to make a video game together, just let me know.</p>
        <h2>About This Site</h2>
        <p>I made this site cause I wanted to learn HTML and CSS. Also I just kinda think it's funny to have a clearly amateur website. I also wanted a place to showcase my work, as if my Itch page wasn't doing fine at that.</p>
        <h2>About "Bluestone"</h2>
        <p>That's been my go-to username for years, usually with a "19" at the end. I also considered "Jclermont," since that's my username on Itch, but my dad has that domain.</p>
        <h2>About My Games</h2>
        <p>I've released a bunch of Pico-8 games, but I've also worked a lot with Unity. I just haven't really released much stuff made in Unity.</p>
