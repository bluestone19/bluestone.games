        <h1>About Everything</h1>
        <h2>About Jonas Clermont</h2>
        <p>How are you? I'm Jonas, and I'm trying to make video games sometimes. I hope you'll give some of my work a try. Or, if you ever want to make a video game together, just let me know.</p>
		<p>To be honest, I haven't really been doing much actual game development lately. Maybe one day I'll get back into it, but I'd say not to hold your breath.</p>
        <h2>About This Site</h2>
        <p>I made this site cause I wanted to learn HTML and CSS. I also just kinda think it's funny to have a website like this. It's also a place to showcase my work, as if my Itch page wasn't doing fine at that.</p>
        <p>I'll be using this to host some other things too, might as well get the most out of owning this domain.</p>
        <h2>About "Bluestone"</h2>
        <p>That's been my go-to username for years, usually with a "19" at the end. I also considered "Jclermont," since that's my username on Itch, but my dad has that domain.</p>
        <p>Of course, if you scroll through my games you might also notice some have Bluestone as a character. He's supposed to be some kinda blue slime-ish blob guy.</p>
        <h2>About My Games</h2>
        <p>I've released a bunch of Pico-8 games, but I've also worked a lot with Unity. I just haven't really released much stuff made in Unity.</p>
        <h2>About Using My Stuff</h2>
        <p>Feel free to send me an email and ask, if you want to use my work in your own projects. Just let me know what you're working on and I'll probably send back the OK.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I will never allow my work to be used in or associated with any kind of blockchain project. I'm absolutely sick of seeing that junk, and I want nothing to do with it.</li>
            <li>If you want to reuse my code (don't know why you would, it's pretty bad) that's all good. Just don't make it too obvious, clean it up or edit it a bit to fit your needs.</li>
            <li>If you want to use my work in something you're selling, make sure to check with me. I usually won't have a problem with it, as long as it isn't Crypto.</li>
            <li>Wanna remake or port one of my games? That'd be really cool if you did.</li>
            <li>This page isn't giving you permission for anything and isn't a license. Again, just email me. Please. I like getting emails.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>About Contacting Me</h2>
        <p>Feel free to email me. As long as you're not being malicious or spammy, I like to hear from real people who found my work. Did you see how I've got a form on that page too? You can use it!</p>
		<p>Actually, I did get a few funny messages on that form. I mean, mostly spam, but at least the funny kind. For example, the two latest ones were very vague, and seemed to want me to respond, but left no contact info. One was "some leads" which are "interested" in my "company," and the other just happened to "notice" my "website" hasn't "embraced AI capabilities" yet. I am not interested in the suggestions these clowns have. There was also a really long comment trying to sell me on setting up a chat bot or something.</p>
		<p>There was also one pun submitted by an unidentified family member. I'm guessing my dad. Thank you for the encouraging comments!</p>
		<h2>About Upcoming Projects</h2>
        <p>You might have noticed that whatever project I list on my homepage as "upcoming" has remained unreleased for a long time. I tell myself I'll finish it some day, but I think we both know how that goes.</p>
        <h2>About Plans</h2>
        <p>I'm pretty bad at plans, but I'm arguably pretty good at wanting to do things. Here's some things I want to do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Port a single game to a ridiculous number of different platforms</li>
            <lI>Release a game on a home console, like the PS5 or Xbox. I would've wanted to make one on the 3DS, but... you know. Time waits for no one</lI>
            <li>Get hired to make a game? Maybe</li>
            <li>Make a game console, totally open-source, and low-spec enough to be an interesting challenge</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>About Interests</h2>
        <p>Besides game development, I have other interests too. For example, I like Balloon Fight and its sequels, released by Nintendo starting in 1984.</p>
        <p>I also have a single spotify playlist full of my top 100 favorite songs that I listen to on shuffle. Songs go in and out pretty often. I'll only let you see it if you promise not to make fun of my taste in music.</p>
