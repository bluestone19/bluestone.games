        <h1>What's up gamers</h1>
        <p>Welcome to <em>Bluestone.Games</em>, the ultimate resource for all things gaming. Or at least, it will be one day. Right now I'm working on building this site a bit more, adding some more backgrounds with stunning 3D graphics, and trying to figure out how to lay out all the content I wanna post here.</p>
        <p>Here you can find my contact info, look at most of my projects, and play proof-of-concept demos I haven't posted anywhere else. I hope you enjoy looking through my portfolio and hiring me.</p>
